# AggieCompiler
This project scope is to provide resources to incoming NMSU students as well as provide a system that professors can use for teaching purposes. 

This project uses flask and sqlalchemy so if you want to run these files and any web pages they create, then you need to have flask and alchemy installed on your device. Later iterations will make it so that this isn't a requirement as we will have uploaded the project somehow. In any case, as of right now, the way to run this project is with the simple command "python main.py" where main is the name of the main file. You can do this in the command line but I imagine that if you have any other ways of running a python file, those ways will also work.

Getting back to the project however, it will have three main functions that come in the form of web pages. Those functions are the following: Compiler, Roadmap, and Q&A. 

Compiler IDL (Integrated Development Learning): 

  Our website IDL provides languages that are mainly used and taught at NMSU. By signing up and being logged in you'll be able to download your coding
  files that you've accomplished and by signing up (creating an account) will require you to use your NMSU email address in order to ensure NMSU students 
  are primarily the ones to use this website. The compiler itself will run and debug your code and will be available at the home page for practical easy
  use. 
  
  
Roadmap:

  This will be an interactable roadmap that students can use in order to know what they can start studying. It will have resources that are correlating
  to specific classes. This will hopefully help students retain information and help them understand somehting that their teachers might now have 
  been able to explain as well.
  
Q&A:
  
  This will be very reddit like. A user can come here and post questions under class tabs. These questions can then be answer by other users. The 
  questions are going to be grouped by classes and general. 
  
Other:

  There will be other implementations such as a theme mode and user accounts, but those features are not the main focuse of this project. As such, 
  they will not be prioratized and might not even be implemented. Whether or not they are is dependent on time.
