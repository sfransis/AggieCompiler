# AggieCompiler
Project that is meant to help newer NMSU CS students on their journey to understanding. 

This project uses flask and sqlalchemy so if you want to run these files and any web pages they create, then you need to have flask and alchemy installed on your device. Later iterations will make it so that this isn't a requirement as we will have uploaded the project somehow. In any case, as of right now, the way to run this project is with the simple command "python main.py" where main is the name of the main file. You can do this in the command line but I imagine that if you have any other ways of running a python file, those ways will also work.

Getting back to the project however, it will have three main functions that come in the form of web pages. Those functions are the following: Compiler, Roadmap, and Q&A. 

Compiler: 

  This is like any other web compiler. You will be able to upload and download files and compile thoes files if they are written in one of the languages
  we have worked with. This is for a NMSU CS student however so those languages that you can compile in are limited to the languages that have been used
  and taught in the NMSU CS department. 
  
Roadmap:

  This will be an interactable roadmap that students can use in order to know what they can start studying. It will have resources that are correlating
  to specific classes. This will hopefully help students retain information and help them understand somehting that their teachers might now have 
  been able to explain as well.
  
Q&A:
  
  This will be very reddit like. A user can come here and post questions under class tabs. These questions can then be answer by other users. The 
  questions are going to be grouped by classes and general. 
  
Other:

  There will be other implementations such as a theme mode and user accounts, but those features are not the main focuse of this project. As such, 
  they will not be prioratized and might not even be implemented. Whether or not they are is dependent on time.
